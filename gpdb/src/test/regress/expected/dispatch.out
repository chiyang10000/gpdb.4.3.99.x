-- Misc tests related to dispatching queries to segments.
-- Test quoting of GUC values and databse names when they're sent to segments
-- There used to be a bug in the quoting when the search_path setting was sent
-- to the segment. It was not easily visible when search_path was set with a
-- SET command, only when the setting was sent as part of the startup packet.
-- Set search_path as a per-user setting so that we can test that.
